# DApp Development Tutorial 4:  Asch DApp Dice Game

Compare with previous "mini dao" project, this "dice game" project has far more lines of code, hence far more functionalities. The project generates three types of contracts, and there are dependencies among these three types. Also, the execution of the contracts has to depend on historical transaction data.

However, these two projects still have the very similar underlying logic. So please watch through the [source code](https://github.com/sqfasd/asch-dice-game-dapp) and you will find it is easy to understand.
